When running on a Mac, if you choose this option, and then select your Applications folder, Notenik will import one Note for each application found in the folder. If duplicates are found then the existing notes will be updated rather than adding new notes. You will get the best results by first specifying a 'template.txt' file for the Collection in the following format.

		Title:  The unique title for this note

		Tags:   One or more tags, separated by commas

		Link:   http://anyurl.com

		Date:   2017-01-22

		Seq:    Rev Letter or Version Number

		Minimum System Version:

		Body:   
 
		The body of the note

After the import, you can use the Tags field to organize the applications in any way you like, and clicking on the Link field will launch the selected application.
