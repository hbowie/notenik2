Title:  Export to Tab-Delimited for MS Links

Seq:    12.3

Tags:   File.Export

Body:   
 
Similar to tab-delimited, but the Title and link are concatenated into a single field, with a '#' character separating the title from the link. Some Microsoft apps can use this format to import each link into a special field that combines the title and the hyperlink into a single field.
