Title:  Override Default Fields with a Template file

Seq:    16

Tags:   default, fields, template

Body:   
 
By default, Notenik shows only four Fields for a Note: Title, Link, Tags and Body. However, this default may be altered by placing a file named 'template.txt' or 'template.md' within a Collection's folder. Such a file should be in the normal Notenik format, although the Field Labels specified need not have any accompanying values. When such a template file is found, the field names found in this file will be used as the fields to be displayed and maintained for that Collection, overriding the default four. 

If you are using a field other than one of the Notenik standard fields described elsewhere in this document, then you may specify the type of field desired by placing a special value within a pair of less-than greater-than signs, following the field name and the delimiting colon. 

Here are the currently recognized values:

	<3> - A long text field, with multiple lines for data entry. 
	<builder> - A long text field, with multiple lines for data entry. 
	<longtext> - A long text field, with multiple lines for data entry. 

You may use the Generate Template command on the File menu to create a template file. You can then use any text editor to modify the sample template file to reflect the fields you desire for that Collection. 

The file extension used for the template file will be used as the file extension for Notes subsequently created within the Collection.
