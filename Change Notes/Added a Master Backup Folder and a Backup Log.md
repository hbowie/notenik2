Body:   
 
The Files Tab on the application Preferences now allows the user to specify a Master Backup Folder. When this is specified, along with the option for Automatic Backups, backups will be done automatically by Notenik. In order to provide user visibility into what is going on in the background, Notenik will maintain a log named '- Backup Log.txt' within the Master Backup Folder.
