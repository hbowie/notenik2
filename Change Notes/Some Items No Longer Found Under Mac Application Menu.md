Due to changes in Java and Apple's support for Java, Java version 8 and JavaFX no longer support making certain application windows accessible from the Mac Application Menu (in this case, the far left Menu labeled 'Notenik'). 

The About Menu Item now appears consistenly under the Help Menu. 

The Preferences window now appears consistently under the Options Menu.
